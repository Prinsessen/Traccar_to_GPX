## Ghost Jump Filtering

The script includes a powerful feature to filter out GPS "ghost jumps" - erroneous data points where the device appears to teleport large distances in unrealistic time frames. This is common with:
- Poor GPS signal
- GPS drift
- Sensor errors
- Data transmission issues

**How it works:**
1. Calculates the speed between consecutive GPS points using the Haversine formula
2. Removes points where the calculated speed exceeds your threshold
3. Keeps the previous valid point and continues from there

**Recommended thresholds:**
- **200 km/h** - Good for cars, trucks, and most vehicles
- **500 km/h** - Suitable for aircraft and high-speed vehicles  
- **Custom** - Set your own threshold based on your tracking needs
- **Disabled** - Keep all data points unfiltered

**Example:** If your device jumps from New York to London in 5 minutes (clearly impossible), that point will be filtered out.

## GPS Accuracy Filtering

Many GPS receivers report an "accuracy" value representing the estimated error radius in meters. Points with high accuracy values indicate poor satellite visibility, weak signal, or unreliable positioning - often the root cause of jitter and noise.

**How it works:**
1. Checks the `accuracy` field reported by the GPS receiver
2. Removes points where accuracy exceeds your threshold
3. Keeps points without accuracy data (assumes valid)
4. Always retains at least one point even if all are filtered

**Recommended thresholds:**
- **50m** - Good balance for most use cases (recommended)
- **30m** - Stricter filtering for cleaner tracks
- **20m** - Very strict, best for areas with good GPS coverage
- **Custom** - Set your own threshold based on requirements
- **Disabled** - Keep all points regardless of accuracy

**Why filter by accuracy?** Poor GPS fixes (accuracy > 50m) often indicate:
- Weak satellite signal (urban canyons, indoors, tunnels)
- Cold start or GPS reacquisition
- Device hardware limitations
- Atmospheric interference

Filtering these points removes the primary source of jitter and noise in your tracks.

## Drift Noise Filtering

The script can remove low-speed GPS drift that happens while a device is stationary and acquiring a fix. It drops points where both:
- Speed is below a small threshold (e.g., 8–10 km/h)
- Displacement from the previous kept point is tiny (e.g., 30–50 m)

**Presets:**
- 10 km/h & 50 m (recommended default)
- 8 km/h & 30 m (stricter)
- Custom thresholds
- Disabled

**Example:** At startup, GPS may report a few wandering points within 30 m while stopped; these are removed so tracks start cleanly from the true location.

## Small-Jitter Filtering

Targets tiny stop/start wiggles near the last known point (often when pulling away or coming to a stop). It drops points where:
- Speed is below a modest threshold (e.g., 12–15 km/h)
- Displacement from the last kept point is tiny (e.g., 10–15 m)

**Presets:**
- 15 km/h & 15 m (recommended)
- 12 km/h & 10 m (stricter)
- Custom thresholds
- Disabled

**Tip:** Use this after drift filtering to keep starts/stops clean without harming normal low-speed movement.

## Output File Naming

Files are automatically named using the pattern:
```
{DeviceName}_{StartDate}_{EndDate}.{extension}
```

Example: `Vehicle_1_20260102_20260103.gpx`

## Error Handling

The script includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Network connection issues
- Invalid credentials
- No data available for selected time range
- API request failures
- File write errors
- User input validation

## Traccar API Compatibility

This script is designed to work with Traccar API (v5.x and above) and has been **tested and verified working** with production Traccar servers. 

It uses the following endpoints:
- `/api/session` - Authentication (POST with form-encoded credentials)
- `/api/devices` - Device list
- `/api/positions` - Position data

**Authentication Method:** The script uses POST requests with **form-encoded credentials** (`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`), not JSON, for compatibility with Traccar's authentication handler. The script automatically tries both `/api/session` and `/api/session/` endpoints for maximum compatibility.

## Security Notes

- Never commit your credentials to version control
- Use environment variables for production deployments
- Consider using Traccar API tokens for enhanced security
- By default credentials are not stored; they are only used for the current session
- Optional local credential storage uses `~/.traccar_exporter/credentials.json` with file mode 600 (user-only)

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Problem:** `HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type` or `HTTP 404 Not Found` error

**Solution:** ✅ This has been fixed! The script now:
1. Sends credentials as form-encoded data (required by Traccar)
2. Automatically tries both `/api/session` and `/api/session/` endpoints
3. Shows detailed connection debugging output

**If you still have connection issues:**
1. Verify your server URL format: `https://your-server.com` (without trailing slash)
2. Double-check your email and password
3. Ensure your Traccar server is accessible from your network
4. Check that you're using the latest version of the script

**Example URLs:**
- ✓ Correct: `https://traccar.example.com` or `https://gps.yourdomain.com`
- ✗ Incorrect: `https://traccar.example.com/`

### Common Issues

1. **Invalid Credentials** - Double-check your email and password are correct for your Traccar account
2. **Server Unreachable** - Verify the server URL and network connectivity
3. **SSL Certificate Warnings** - The script includes debug mode with disabled SSL verification. For production use, you can enable SSL verification in the code
4. **No Devices Found** - Ensure you have at least one device configured in your Traccar account
5. **No Position Data** - The selected time range may not contain any tracking data for the chosen device

### Success Indicators

When the connection works correctly, you'll see:
```
Attempting connection to: https://your-server.com/api/session
Sending credentials: email=your@email.com
Response status: 200
✓ Successfully connected to Traccar server
```
